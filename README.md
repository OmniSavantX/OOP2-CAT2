 This is a simple JavaFx RMI application documented using javadocs. Before running the application, make sure that you have downloaded the sql file provided and started mysql (Assuming it is installed) or the application will simply not work. To simply run the application, you  have to run the three .bat files included. You start with the app.bat which contains codes for both compiling all the .java files and starting the RMI Registry. This window for rmi registry should not be closed but rather minimized. The next one to run is Server.bat. This one contains the code to run the Server Program. This one also should not be closed. The last one is Client.bat. This contains code to run the Client Application of which in result you should end up with a GUI which you can do create, retrieve and delete on the database. The console window for the client should not be closed. If you want to rerun the program, you need to simply close all console windows and reopen all the 3 .bat files afresh to avoid errors.
